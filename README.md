A simple monster collection and battle game, inspired by classic creature-collecting games.  
Players can catch monsters, train them, level them up, and battle against other creatures using abilities with type effectiveness.

## Features

- Collect unique monsters with different stats, types, and abilities
- Turn-based battle system with type effectiveness
- Level up your monsters to increase their stats
- Simple catching mechanics with rarity-based chance
- SQLite database backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Modular and easy to expand with new monsters, abilities, and types

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- SQLite
- Modular code structure for game logic and models
